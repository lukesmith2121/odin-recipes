Odin recipe project
This project is a start to truly learning HTML, by the end of this project I should be proficient in html framework. Using <em> <strong> <a href> <img src> <img alt><ol> <ul> <li>
=======
This is the first Odin project, still learning html and feeling very comfortable, this will be updated as time goes on with css/js.

Just added CSS and committed to github, had trouble because I had 2 copies of htmls..deleted old files and replaced with new.
